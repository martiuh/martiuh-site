        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm a self-taught frontend developer who started coding back in 2014 when
          I decided that I didn't want to work as a criminologist (the mayor that I just
            had finished back then) and instead want to make a carreer or a living doing things
            with computers.
