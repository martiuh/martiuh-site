## My first paid project

This is my biggest project yet, the apprach I chose was to build two apps, one as the backend, a REST API build with `loopback` connected to a `postgresql` database. And the second app is an universal app build with `react`.

It took me about a year to develop, I made three major rewrites of the code (I added code splitting an server side rendering) and I'm really proud of it.

### Challenges
Since this was my biggest project yet I did a lot of things to get this project going.

- Make server side rendering with React
- Learn what code-splitting and the universal approach (I made this thanks to `react-universal-component` and a lot of its related-projects)
- Learn loopback and make custom methods for each endpoint
- Improve my knwoledge of express
- Build API gateways
- I tried to setup a service-worker but it messed up the site more than it helped
- Host a node app in shared-hosting (a2hosting.com)
